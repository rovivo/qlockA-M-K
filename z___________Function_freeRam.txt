Another method that seems to be even simpler is the following: Declare this function:



int freeRam () {
  extern int __heap_start, *__brkval; 
  int v; 
  return (int) &v - (__brkval == 0 ? (int) &__heap_start : (int) __brkval); 
}




and call it anywhere in your program like that: Serial.println(freeRam());
